												<h3>Driver Drowsiness Level Detection in an Automobile</h3>
											</header>
											<h4><u>Skills</u> : Computer Vision, Time Series, Deep Learning</h4>
											<p> - I was working on this problem statement in my company at <b>Bosch Global Software Technologies.</b><br/>
												- As we all know, a lot of accidents happen due to driver feeling drowsy if driving for a long time. It is important to work on this problem statement
												  as to avoid these accidents.
												- Our aim was to detect the drowsiness level of driver which was our target feature. It was <b>labelled as 1 - 10, 1 being least drowsy and vice-versa.</b><br/>
												- We prepared our dataset using <b>facial features extracted from images</b> taken using interior cameras. Video data was collected through various.
												  drivers and those videos were converted to base-signals using <b>feature extraction techniques</b> which were there used for data preparation and model training part.<br/>
												- We framed this as a <b>time series problem</b> by drawing an analogy that a driver feels drowsy after driving it for a long time. 
												  We performed experiments using various <b>deep learning algorithms (ANNs, RNNs, LSTMs).</b> <br/>

												<h3>Driver Seat-Belt Detection in an Automobile</h3>
											</header>
											<h4><u>Skills</u> : Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Explainable AI</h4>
											<p> - I was working on this problem statement in my company at <b>Bosch Global Software Technologies.</b><br/>
												- A lot of critical injuries might happen if a driver meets with an accident if seatbelt is not worn. So our main aim was to detect if <b>driver has worn a seatbelt
												  or not</b> while driving. 
												- We had collected <b>real time images</b> from interior cameras in an automobile. These images also had various <b>corner cases like driver wearing black clothes and had black
												  seatbelt</b>, or <b>patterned clothes having black and white stripes</b>.
												- Fine-tuned <b>object detection models Mobile Net, Efficient Net</b> for detection of seat-belt purpose. Got <b>accuracy of 92%</b> after building complete solution.
												  To improve the accuracy we were working on corner-cases as mentioned in above point by using <b>explainable AI techniques such as Grad-CAM. </b>

												<h3>Test Cases prediction using Natural language Processing Techniques.</h3>
											</header>
											<h4><u>Skills</u> : Natural Language processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Deployment</h4>
											<p> - I was working on this problem statement in my company at <b>Bosch Global Software Technologies.</b><br/>
												- This was a classification problem where target feature consisted of 8 components of an automobile (such as chasis, audio software, camera module,etc)
												- Our problem statement was to assign test cases collected from users to be automatically assigned to respective component department without manual interruption.
												- We used advanced deep learning like <b>Transformer based solutions</b> using <b>Natural Language processing techniques as our dataset was textual</b>.
												- Implemented <b>Word2Vec model for data augmentation</b> and used it for fine-tuning a <b>BERT model to fetch word-embeddings</b>.
												- <b>Increased performance of existing model by 6%</b>. Developed an API using <b>FastAPI</b> for production purpose.

												<h3>An Eye for blind - Image Captioning using Deep Learning</h3>
											</header>
											<h4><u>Skills</u> : Computer Vision, Deep Learning (Attention mechanism), Natural Language Processing</h4>
											<p> - Built an <b>image captioning model and read captions aloud for blind people.</b>
												- Data had around 8000 images with 5 captions per image, used NLTK and Keras for captions and images pre-processing, <b>Encoder - Attention -  Decoder </b>with CNN as encoder 
												  and RNN as decoder, transfer learning through <b>InceptionV3</b> model.
												- <b>BLEU score</b> was used for evaluating the captions.<br/>
												- This project is end-to-end and deployed on public cloud platform. You can try it out by clicking on button below.

												<h3>Flight Fare Prediction using Machine Learning(Ensemble Model)</h3>
											</header>
											<h4><u>Skills</u> : Data Analysis, Machine Learning</h4>
											<p> - I like to travel a lot. So for this purpose I thought it would be better if try to analyse this data and make a model out of it just for
												  academic purpose.<br/>
												- The dataset consists of records for different airlines,travel routes,stops,sources,destination,date of journeyprice,etc.Price is the target variable.
												- This project is end-to-end and deployed on public cloud platform. You can try it out by clicking on button below.

												<h3>Sales Forecasting using Time Series Modelling</h3>
											</header>
											<h4><u>Skills</u> : Data Analysis, Time Series, Machine Learning</h4>
											<p> - Built a model to forecast sales of a drug seller store.
												- Treated Outliers by capping, examined for trend and seasonality of data.
												- Causality tests were performed to check if other times series affect target time series or not.
												- Used VAR/ VARMA/ VARMAX models, exogenous variables to check performance of models, RMSE metric for evaluation.
